## What does UAE law require?

Under the Insurance Authority Regulations 2015 and the UAE Motor Vehicle Insurance Law, every vehicle on UAE roads must carry at minimum a **Third Party Only (TPO)** policy. Driving without one is a criminal offence that can result in a AED 250,000 fine or six months' imprisonment.

## The three cover types explained

| Cover Type | What it pays | Typical annual premium |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Third Party Only (TPO) | Injury/death/damage to other people and property | AED 15,000 – AED 25,000 |
| Third Party Fire & Theft (TPF&T) | TPO + your car if stolen or burnt | AED 35,000 – AED 60,000 |
| Comprehensive | Everything above + your own vehicle in accidents | AED 65,000 – AED 180,000+ |

## Key factors that change your premium

1. **Market value of your car** — insurers use declared value, not purchase price
2. **Driver age** — under-25 drivers attract a loading of up to 20%
3. **Claims history** — a claim in the last 3 years typically adds 15%
4. **Use type** — private use is cheaper than commercial or hire purchase
5. **Emirate** — Dubai and Abu Dhabi have higher base rates than smaller emirates

## Our top picks for 2025

**Best overall:** AXA Gulf — strong claims record (98%), DHA compliance, and 24/7 roadside assistance.

**Best budget:** ADNIC — starting from AED 15,000 for TPO, claims processed within 48 hours.

**Best for new cars:** GIG Gulf — new-for-old replacement guarantee for vehicles under 3 years old.

## How to get the lowest price

The single most effective way to save is to **compare multiple insurers** before buying. Prices for identical cover can vary by 20–30% across IA-licensed providers. Use InsureAE to get instant quotes from all major insurers in under 3 minutes.

## What is the DHA?

The **UAE Insurers Industry Database (DHA)** is a centralised platform managed by the UAE Insurers Association (NIA) that records every valid motor insurance policy in the country. When you buy a motor policy, your insurer registers it on the DHA and issues a tamper-proof certificate.

## Why it matters

Traffic officers, VIO (Vehicle Inspection Officers), and police checkpoints can now verify your insurance in real-time by scanning the QR code on your windscreen sticker or checking the DHA portal. Fake certificates — once rampant — are immediately flagged.

## What information appears on the certificate

- Vehicle registration number
- Policy number and insurer name
- Cover type (TPO, TPF&T, or Comprehensive)
- Policy start and expiry dates
- DHA verification QR code

## How to get yours instantly

When you buy through InsureAE, your certificate is issued digitally within **3 minutes** of payment. You can:
- Download the PDF immediately
- Print the windscreen sticker
- Share by email or WhatsApp

Your policy is simultaneously registered on the DHA — no manual registration required.

## What if your certificate is expired?

An expired DHA certificate is treated the same as no insurance at all. Renew at least a week before expiry to avoid any gap in cover. InsureAE sends automatic renewal reminders 30 days before your policy expires.

## The Schengen requirement

All 26 Schengen-area countries require proof of travel insurance as part of the visa application. The policy must:

- Cover medical emergencies and hospitalisation up to **€30,000 minimum**
- Include emergency repatriation to UAE
- Be valid for the entire duration of your stay plus entry/exit days
- Come from an insurer recognised in the destination country

## Common mistakes that get applications rejected

1. **Insufficient cover** — some insurers offer €10,000 or €15,000 plans. These will fail the Schengen test.
2. **Wrong dates** — policy must cover arrival and departure days, not just the nights you're staying
3. **Excluded activities** — if you plan to ski or do adventure sports, standard cover may not apply
4. **Domestic-only insurer** — some UAE HMOs offer "international" cover that doesn't meet Schengen criteria

## What to look for when buying

✅ Medical cover: €30,000 minimum (€50,000 recommended for peace of mind)
✅ Repatriation of remains
✅ 24/7 emergency assistance line with English-speaking operators
✅ Policy document in English (embassies require this)
✅ Clear start/end dates matching your visa application

## Our recommended plans

All travel plans on InsureAE are Schengen-compliant and issued in under 5 minutes. GIG Gulf's Travel policy offers €50,000 medical cover and is accepted by all EU embassies. Prices start from AED 28,000 for a 2-week trip.

    title: "HMO vs Health Insurance in UAE: What's the Real Difference?",
    excerpt:
      'Confused by HMO, NHIS, and private health insurance? This plain-language guide explains which is right for your family or business.',

## The short answer

An **HMO (Health Maintenance Organisation)** is the company that manages your healthcare — they maintain a network of hospitals and pay bills directly (cashless). **Health insurance** is the financial product that funds your care. In UAE, most people use these terms interchangeably, but the distinction matters when choosing cover.

## NHIS vs Private HMO

| | NHIS | Private HMO |
|--|------|-------------|
| Cost | Subsidised (employer contributes) | Market rate |
| Network | Government facilities mainly | Private hospitals included |
| Processing speed | Slow | Fast (hours not weeks) |
| Maternity cover | Basic | Often comprehensive |
| Best for | Formal-sector employees | Self-employed, SMEs, families |

## Key things to check before buying

1. **Hospital network** — confirm your preferred hospital is accredited. Hygeia has 700+ facilities; some smaller HMOs cover fewer than 50.
2. **Waiting period** — most plans have a 30-90 day waiting period for pre-existing conditions
3. **Annual limit** — typical family plans cap at AED 5m–AED 20m per year. Understand what happens if you exceed it
4. **Maternity rider** — often sold separately; check exclusions for caesarean sections
5. **Dental and vision** — almost always optional add-ons, not included by default

## What a plan on InsureAE covers

All medical plans listed on InsureAE are from IA-licensed HMOs. You can compare networks, limits, and pricing side-by-side — and get covered in under 10 minutes.

## Why most UAE SMEs have no cover — and why that's changing

A 2024 survey by the UAE Insurance Authority found that fewer than 12% of UAE SMEs carry any form of business insurance. The main reasons: perceived cost, complexity of policies, and lack of awareness. Yet 70% of businesses that suffer a major uninsured loss never reopen.

## The core covers every business needs

### 1. Fire and Special Perils
Covers your building, stock, and equipment against fire, flood, lightning, and explosion. This is the most fundamental cover and is legally required for businesses above a certain size.

### 2. Burglary and Theft
Pays for stolen stock, equipment, and cash following a break-in. Note: standard policies cover forced entry only — internal theft requires a separate Fidelity Guarantee policy.

### 3. Public Liability
If a customer slips in your shop or is injured on your premises, you're legally liable. This cover pays legal costs and damages. Essential for any business with customer footfall.

### 4. Employers' Liability
Required by law under the Employees' Compensation Act 2010 if you have more than one employee. Covers medical costs and compensation for work-related injuries.

### 5. Business Interruption
If your premises are damaged and you can't trade, this cover replaces your lost gross profit and pays fixed costs (rent, salaries) while you rebuild.

## What does it cost?

A basic combined policy for a typical Dubai retail SME starts from around AED 120,000/year — less than AED 10,000/month. Compare that to the average burglary loss of AED 2.5m.

## Step 1: Notify your insurer immediately

Most policies require you to notify your insurer within **24–48 hours** of an incident. Late notification can be used to reduce or deny your claim. Call the emergency line on your certificate, then follow up in writing (email or WhatsApp).

## Step 2: Document everything

For motor claims:
- Take photos of all damage from multiple angles
- Get the other driver's name, registration, and insurer details
- Note the date, time, location, and weather conditions
- Obtain a police report (essential for claims above AED 500,000)

For property/business claims:
- Photograph all damaged items before touching them
- Keep all receipts, purchase records, and valuations
- Do not discard damaged items until your loss adjuster has assessed them

## Step 3: Complete the claim form

Your insurer will send a claim notification form. Fill it in fully and honestly. Any material misrepresentation — even minor — can void the claim under UAE insurance law.

## Step 4: Loss adjuster assessment

For significant claims, your insurer appoints an independent loss adjuster to assess the damage. Cooperate fully. The adjuster's report directly determines your payout.

## Step 5: Settlement

Under IA guidelines, insurers must acknowledge claims within 5 working days and settle within **90 days** of receiving all required documents. If your claim is delayed, you can escalate to IA directly.

## What can cause a claim to be rejected?

- Policy lapsed at the time of the incident
- Exclusion applies (e.g., driving under the influence)
- Delay in notification
- Incomplete documentation
- Material misrepresentation on the original application
